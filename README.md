## Overview

This project is intended to easily spin environments and plug them in on any CI/CD system through ssh. 

mapt create the target machine and return the information and credentials required to connect within the target marchine (host + username + private key)

Also mapt offers a set of features wich are transversal to each type of target machine as so they can be applied to any of them (airgap, proxyed, vpn,...)
