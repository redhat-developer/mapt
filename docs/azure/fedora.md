# Overview

mapt offers several operations to manage environments within azure:

## Fedora

It creates / destroy a Fedora machine ready to be included within the CI/CD system. Features included within the offering:

* Setup ssh for the user with a self generated private key

### Operations

#### Create

This will create a fedora instance according to params specified:

```bash
podman run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-developer/mapt:0.7.0-dev azure fedora create -h
create

Usage:
  mapt azure fedora create [flags]

Flags:
      --arch string                      architecture for the machine. Allowed x86_64 or arm64 (default "x86_64")
      --conn-details-output string       path to export host connection information (host, username and privateKey)
      --cpus int32                       Number of CPUs for the cloud instance (default 8)
  -h, --help                             help for create
      --location string                  If spot is passed location will be calculated based on spot results. Otherwise localtion will be used to create resources. (default "West US")
      --memory int32                     Amount of RAM for the cloud instance in GiB (default 64)
      --nested-virt                      Use cloud instance that has nested virtualization support
      --spot                             if spot is set the spot prices across all regions will be cheked and machine will be started on best spot option (price / eviction)
      --spot-eviction-tolerance string   if spot is enable we can define the minimum tolerance level of eviction. Allowed value are: lowest, low, medium, high or highest (default "lowest")
      --tags stringToString              tags to add on each resource (--tags name1=value1,name2=value2) (default [])
      --username string                  username for general user. SSH accessible + rdp with generated password (default "rhqp")
      --version string                   linux version. Version should be formated as X.Y (Major.minor) (default "40.0")
      --vmsize strings                   set specific size for the VM and ignore any CPUs, Memory and Arch parameters set. Type requires to allow nested virtualization

Global Flags:
      --backed-url string     backed for stack state. Can be a local path with format file:///path/subpath or s3 s3://existing-bucket
      --project-name string   project name to identify the instance of the stack
```
> *NOTE:* Fedora distro version needs to be in the form x.y, but official fedora versions contain just the major version. For fedora 40 use `--version 40.0`

> *NOTE:* You can list all the available fedora images using `az`, please refer: https://fedoramagazine.org/launch-fedora-40-in-microsoft-azure for more information

It will crete a fedora instance and will give as result several files located at path defined by `--conn-details-output`:


* username: file containing the username for worker user
* id_rsa: file containing the private key for worker user
* host: file containing the public ip for the instance

Also, it will create a state folder holding the state for the created resources at azure, the path for this folder is defined within `--backed-url`, the content from that folder it is required with the same project name (`--project-name`) in order to destroy the resources.

When running the container image it is required to pass the authentication information as variables, following a sample snipped on how to create
a instance with default values:

```bash
podman run -d --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/workspace:z \
    -e ARM_TENANT_ID=${ati_value} \
    -e ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=${asi_value} \
    -e ARM_CLIENT_ID=${aci_value} \
    -e ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=${acs_lue} \
    quay.io/redhat-developer/mapt:0.7.0-dev azure \
        fedora create \
        --project-name "fedora-40" \
        --backed-url "file:///workspace" \
        --conn-details-output "/workspace" \
        --spot
```

The following is a snippet on how to destroy the resources:

```bash
podman run -d --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/workspace:z \
    -e ARM_TENANT_ID=${ati_value} \
    -e ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=${asi_value} \
    -e ARM_CLIENT_ID=${aci_value} \
    -e ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=${acs_lue} \
    quay.io/redhat-developer/mapt:0.7.0-dev azure \
        fedora destroy \
        --project-name "fedora-40" \
        --backed-url "file:///workspace"
```
