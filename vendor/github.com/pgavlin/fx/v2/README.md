The `fx` module contains a number of common utilities for functional programmers, such as map/reduce/filter.
The package also contains utility types for working with pairs, value-or-error enumerations, and sets.

Aside from its root package, this module also contains shape-specific packages that are more convenient when
dealing with slices, maps, and sets.
